# Specificity Graph (for CSS)
Idea by [Harry Roberts](http://csswizardry.com/2014/10/the-specificity-graph/)

![The generated graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pocketjoso/specificity-graph/master/img/example-graph.png)
Generate a graph depicting the specificity in your stylesheet. Uses d3, css-parser, and specificity.

Online demo (coming soon)

## Usage
To get the example `index.html` up and running:
1. Clone repo
2. `npm install`
3. Use something like Browserify to generate a js bundle, for example
  `browserify example.js -o dist/bundle.js`

Then just view `index.html` in your browser (doesn't require any server).
